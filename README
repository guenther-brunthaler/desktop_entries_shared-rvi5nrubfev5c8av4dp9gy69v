Version 2019.311

The contents of the "applications" and "icons" subdirectories (or
a selected subset of those contents) must be synchronized with
subdirectories of the same name below $XDG_DATA_HOME (which
defaults to "$HOME/.local/share").

After synchronizing the files, run the helper script
./scripts/update_menus.sh in order to try to update the diverse
caches used by the desktop environments.
